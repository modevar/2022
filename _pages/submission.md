MODEVAR will receive your submissions via the [official SPLC EasyChair for SPLC 2022](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=splc2022).

You must click on *New Submission* and select the "Fifth International Workshop on Languages for Modelling Variability".



## Submission Guidelines

The submissions must follow the guidelines defined for the [SPLC 2022 workshops](https://2022.splc.net/program/workshops/).

Submission types: Authors interested in participating in the workshop are requested to submit either:

**Regular paper (max. 8 pages)** that presents original research, lessons learned, or a well-argued vision related (but not limited) to the topics on variability modelling languages.

**Short paper (4 pages)** that describes sound new ideas and concepts that are under research or experimental studies.

**Format:** Submissions must adhere to the latest ACM Master Article Template.
Templates for Word and LaTeX are available at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template
Latex users are indicated to use the “sigconf” option, so they are recommended to use the template that can be found in "sample-sigconf.tex".
In this way, the following latex code can be placed at the start of the latex document:
\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}

**Submission:** All papers submitted to the workshop must be unpublished original work and must not have been submitted anywhere else for publication.
